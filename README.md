Kymatio: wavelet scattering in PyTorch
======================================

Kymatio is a Python package for wavelet scattering transforms, built on top of PyTorch.

Use Kymatio if you need a library that:
* integrates wavelet scattering in a deep learning architecture,
* supports 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D wavelets, and
* runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU hardware.

## Installation

### Dependencies

Kymatio requires:

* Python (>= 3.6)
* PyTorch (>= 0.4)
* SciPy (>= 0.13)

We also strongly recommend running Kymatio in a Conda environment since this
simplifies installation of PyTorch.

### Linux

```
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ kymatio==0.0.1
```


### macOS

```
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ kymatio==0.0.1
```



The software was tested on Linux with Anaconda Python 3 and
various GPUs, including Titan X, 1080s, 980s, K20s, and Titan X Pascal.

The software uses PyTorch + NumPy FFT on CPU, and PyTorch + CuPy + CuFFT on GPU.


If you use this code in your work please cite our paper:

This code unifies multiple previous efforts:
    - PyScatWave/ScatWave,
    - ScatNetLight,
    - ScatNet, and others

### Optimized package

If you have a CUDA-enabled GPU, you may run

```
pip install -r requirements_optional_cuda.txt
```

after installation to install the optimized `skcuda` backend. To enable it, set
the `KYMATIO_BACKEND` environment variable to `skcuda`. For more information,
see the documentation.

### Installation from sources

The software can be installed from sources. After cloning the repository, change the directory to the main folder, then:

```
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

Note that you can use `python setup.py develop` that will create a symbolic link to the main folder and is helpful for development.

## Important note: Large images (e.g. ImageNet)

For those interested in applications of the 2-D Scattering Transform on larger images (e.g. Imagenet), it is recommended that you use the `skcuda` backend by setting the environment variable `KYMATIO_BACKEND_2D=skcuda` or changing the 2D default backend in the config file (`~/.config/kymatio/kymatio.cfg` for Linux). This is substantially faster than the torch backend. 


## Documentation

To build the documentation, please run

```
pip install -r requirements_optional.txt
cd doc; make clean; make html
```

You may then read the documentation in `doc/build/html/index.html`.
