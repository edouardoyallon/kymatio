class ScatteringBase3D(ScatteringBase):
    """ Abstract module implementing the scattering transform in 2D. Actual
        implementations of the Scattering2D inherits from its methods and
        attributes. The scattering transform computes two wavelet transform
        followed by modulus non-linearity. It can be summarized as::

            S_J x = [S_J^0 x, S_J^1 x, S_J^2 x]

        for::

            S_J^0 x = x * phi_J
            S_J^1 x = [|x * psi^1_lambda| * phi_J]_lambda
            S_J^2 x = [||x * psi^1_lambda| * psi^2_mu| * phi_J]_{lambda, mu}

        where * denotes the convolution (in space), phi_J is a lowpass
        filter, psi^1_lambda is a family of bandpass
        filters and psi^2_mu is another family of bandpass filters.
        Only Morlet filters are used in this implementation.
        Convolutions are efficiently performed in the Fourier domain.

        Example
        -------
            # 1) Define a Scattering2D object as:
                s = Scattering2D(J, shape=(M, N))
            #    where (M, N) is the image size and 2**J the scale of the scattering
            # 2) Forward on an input Tensor x of shape B x M x N,
            #     where B is the batch size.
                result_s = s(x)

        Parameters
        ----------
        J : int
            Log-2 of the scattering scale.
        shape : tuple of ints
            Spatial support (M, N) of the input.
        L : int, optional
            Number of angles used for the wavelet transform. Defaults to `8`.
        max_order : int, optional
            The maximum order of scattering coefficients to compute. Must be either
            `1` or `2`. Defaults to `2`.
        pre_pad : boolean, optional
            Controls the padding: if set to False, a symmetric padding is applied
            on the signal. If set to True, the software will assume the signal was
            padded externally. Defaults to `False`.
        backend : object, optional
            Controls the backend which is combined with the frontend.

        Attributes
        ----------
        J : int
            Log-2 of the scattering scale.
        shape : tuple of int
            Spatial support (M, N) of the input.
        L : int, optional
            Number of angles used for the wavelet transform.
        max_order : int, optional
            The maximum order of scattering coefficients to compute.
            Must be either equal to `1` or `2`.
        pre_pad : boolean
            Controls the padding: if set to False, a symmetric padding is applied
            on the signal. If set to True, the software will assume the signal was
            padded externally.
        Psi : dictionary
            Contains the wavelets filters at all resolutions. See
            filter_bank.filter_bank for an exact description.
        Phi : dictionary
            Contains the low-pass filters at all resolutions. See
            filter_bank.filter_bank for an exact description.
        M_padded, N_padded : int
             Spatial support of the padded input.

        Notes
        -----
        The design of the filters is optimized for the value L = 8.

        pre_pad is particularly useful when cropping bigger images because
        this does not introduce border effects inherent to padding.
